CPSC 386: Introduction to Game Design and Production - Spring 2022 
Project One, Space Invaders

In this assignment, you will create the Space Invaders game, based on the Alien Invasions! code 
from Project One. The image resources you will need (ship, ship animation destruction, bunker, 
different types of aliens, alien animation destruction, and ufo destruction) will all have to be created 
using an Image editing tool such as Inkscape or Gimp. The audio resources you will need can be 
captured using an audio editor such as Audacity from an online version of Space Invader
